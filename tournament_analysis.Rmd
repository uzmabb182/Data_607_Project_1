## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dbplyr)

```

```{r}
tournament_data <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uzmabb182/Data_607_Project_1/main/tournament.txt", header=F, sep="|", quote = "")

tournament_data
```
# Fetching row count
```{r}
row_count <- nrow(tournament_data)

row_count
```
# Removing the unwanted rows from the dataset
```{r}
tournament_data <- tournament_data[-c(seq(1, row_count, by=3)),]

head(tournament_data)
```

```{r}
row_count <- nrow(tournament_data)

row_count
```

```{r}
n <- length(tournament_data)
```

```{r}

row1 <- tournament_data[seq(2, n, 3)]
row2 <- tournament_data[seq(3, n, 3)]
```

```{r}


```

```{r}


```

```{r}

```

```{r}
# Get working directory path
path <- getwd()

path
# Export file to working directory.  The file.path function has been used to ensure platform independence (i.e. take into account the different path syntaxes for various operating systems)
#write.csv(tournament_data, file.path(path, "chess_cleaned_data.csv"))
```
