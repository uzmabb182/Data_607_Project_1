## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
tournament_data <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uzmabb182/Data_607_Project_1/main/tournament.txt", header=F)
```

```{r}
tournament_data
```
# Removing the unwanted rows above the first row of dataset
```{r}
tournament_data <- tournament_data[-c(1:3),]

head(tournament_data)
```

```{r}
row_count <- length(tournament_data)

row_count
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```
